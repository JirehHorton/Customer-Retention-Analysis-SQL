# Olist E-Commerce SQL Project

This project demonstrates my ability to work with realistic e-commerce datasets using SQL. I built a relational database from multiple tables—including customers, orders, products, and order_items—and performed data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to answer business questions.

Key highlights:

Designed primary and foreign key relationships across multiple tables.

Populated tables with realistic data (full dataset ~78,000 rows).

Created sample subsets (~500–600 rows) for GitHub-friendly sharing.

Explored insights such as customer ordering patterns, product sales, and inventory metrics.

This project showcases skills in SQL, database design, and data manipulation—all directly applicable to business analytics and data engineering roles.
Portfolio project using the Olist e-commerce dataset with SQL &amp; analysis.

⚠️ Note: 
This repo contains only a *sample dataset* (a few rows) for demonstration purposes.  
The full Olist dataset (~100k+ rows) can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
