## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to work with realistic e-commerce datasets using SQL. I built a relational database from multiple tables—including customers, orders, products, and order_items—and performed data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to answer business questions.

Key highlights:
- Designed primary and foreign key relationships across multiple tables.
- Populated tables with realistic data (full dataset ~78,000 rows).
- Created sample subsets (~500–600 rows) for GitHub-friendly sharing.
- Explored insights such as customer ordering patterns, product sales, and inventory metrics.

This project showcases skills in SQL, database design, and data manipulation—all directly applicable to business analytics and data engineering roles.
Portfolio project using the Olist e-commerce dataset with SQL &amp; analysis.

⚠️ Note: 
This repo contains only a *sample dataset* (~500-600 rows) for demonstration purposes and the project analyis utilized a full dataset of 78,000 rows.
The full Olist dataset (~600k+ rows) can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## Sample Data for GitHub
To make the project GitHub-friendly, I created smaller subsets of the full dataset(accessible :

-customers: ~150 rows
-orders: ~150 rows
-products: ~150 rows
-order_items: ~150 rows

These subsets were randomly sampled from the full dataset (~78,000 rows) to preserve the structure and relationships between tables while keeping file sizes manageable.
Note: The full dataset was used during analysis to generate insights, but the sample tables are included for demonstration purposes only.
